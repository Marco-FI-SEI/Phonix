# Phonix

Phonix is the beginning of an e-commerce / user forum web app. Currently, it supports basic CRUD only.

For this project I experimented with:

- React as a frontend library
- Redux to manage state
- Redux-Form to handle form behaviour
- Google OAuth2 authentication
- Tailwind CSS to learn a React-friendly UI framework
- Token-based auth using Rails sessions (not currently implemented in master)
- Redux-auth-wrapper to protect routes (not currently implemented in master)
